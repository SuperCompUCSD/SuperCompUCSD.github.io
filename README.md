This site is run with hugo
To get started first have hugo installed and update git submodules after cloning
```
git clone https://github.com/ieeeucsd/ieeeucsd.org.git
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
Once that is done simply run `hugo serve` and it should be hosted on [localhost:1313](http://localhost:1313)
