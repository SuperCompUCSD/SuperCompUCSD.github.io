Supercomputing @ UCSD was founded in 2019 as a group of a few students looking to participate
in [SCC](https://sc22.supercomputing.org/program/studentssc/student-cluster-competition/),
the Student Cluster Competition, a competition where students from around the world compete
to build the most efficient supercomputer. Since then, we have been competing each year and
slowly but surely building our repertoire of knowledge and experience in HPC. This year,
however, we've become interested in sharing our knowledge with fellow students at UCSD
and empowering them to join this exciting field.

Thanks to our competition experience, we've found multiple fields of interest that have
potential project opportunities, which made us realize that we could be a resource for
students looking to get involved in HPC. We've also found that there are many students
at UCSD who are interested in HPC, but don't know where to start. We hope to be able to
help them find their way into this field.
