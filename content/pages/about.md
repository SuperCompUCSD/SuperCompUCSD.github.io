Supercomputing @ UCSD was founded in 2019 as a group of a few students looking to participate
in [SCC](https://studentclustercompetition.us/),
the Student Cluster Competition, a competition where students from around the world compete
to build the most efficient supercomputer. Since then, we have been competing each year and
slowly but surely building our repertoire of knowledge and experience in HPC.

Thanks to our competition experience, we've found multiple fields of interest that have
potential project opportunities, which made us realize that we could be a resource for
students looking to get involved in HPC. We've also found that there are many students
at UCSD who are interested in HPC, but don't know where to start. We hope to be able to
help them find their way into this field.

The San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC) is one of our mains sponsors and benefactors. 
It was established as one of the nationâ€™s first supercomputer centers in 1985, and for the
past 35 years it has maintained its position as a leader in data-intensive computing and
computer infrastructure. SDSC provides resources, hardware and services to many organizations
in UCSD, in other UC campuses and beyond using its massive community clusters, such as Voyager
and Expanse.

We're located in **SDSC Room 404 and 413** just about any time! Come on by and hang out with us!
