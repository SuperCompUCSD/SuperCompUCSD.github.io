The Single-Board Cluster Competition (SBCC) is a competition hosted by our very own Super Computing Club!
During SBCC, teams from all around the world compete using single-board computers and other similarly simple
hardware to create miniature supercomputing clusters and rank them based on their performance on
industry-standard high-performance computing benchmarks.

This year, SBCC 2025 is hosted at UCSD, in the San Diego Supercomputing Center Auditorium, between April 3-5.
