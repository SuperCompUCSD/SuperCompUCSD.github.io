## The UCSD/SDSC Team

{{< section image="/images/scc-team-photo.jpeg" position="right" >}}

\
Our team has consistently placed first in the U.S. for four consecutive years, outperforming more experienced teams from Europe and Asia with our creativity, rigor, and teamwork. This record has been set with architectures and accelerators, as well as fantastic relationships with sponsors, that challenge the competition.

## Vendor Partnership and Support

{{< section >}}

Participation in the SCC is not possible without support. Vendor support helps cover the cost of the system build and getting it to/from the conference, along with travel and on-site expenses for the competition team. 
This year, the competition has changed the system power limit from 4.5kW to 10kW, resulting in significant increases in our hardware requirements to remain competitive. We need your support to continue our track record of success! We are looking for loaned hardware, monetary contributions, and mentorship/expertise to help our team train and compete. All sponsors will receive recognition for their gifts of hardware, in-kind, or financial donations.
