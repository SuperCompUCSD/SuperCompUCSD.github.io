## 1. NPB
**Description:**
The project aims to set up and run the NASA NAS Parallel Benchmarks on our club nodes. We will focus on setting up MPI on the club nodes, downloading and compiling the benchmarks, and doing minor math (linear algebra) optimizations. This is a simple project, and beginners are welcome. Email amehrotra@ucsd.edu if you’re interested.

**Learning Goals:**
- Learning parallel computing.

**Mentors:** Aarush Mehrotra

**Time Requirement:** 1.5 hours per week

## 2. FPGA Network Interface Card
**Description:**
This project will work on programming a Xilinx FPGA to write some basic accelerators or a processor. Certain classes like ECE111 and CSE141L have these in only simulation, so this is an opportunity to physically test them. If pushed far enough, we may work on writing a linux kernel driver or HLS applications. Anyone is welcome to deviate or write their own HDL for fun.

**Meetings:** Fridays from 11AM-1PM at SDSC floor 4

**Mentors:** Paco Gutierrez

**Time Requirements:** 3-5 hours/week

## 3. Linux From Scratch
**Description:**
This project aims to go through the process of setting up the Linux From Scratch project. This project will help you understand the internals of Linux and hopefully allow people on the edge of making the switch to Linux to learn how to use it better. Message Luiz on Discord at @avvyxx if you're interested!

**Meetings:** Will send out a when2meet after the GBM

**Mentors:** Luiz Gurrola

**Time Requirements**: 2-3 hours/week

## 4. RISC-V Architecture

**Description:** We will be building a low cost cluster from 16 CH32V003 Microcrontrollers. These microcontrollers use the RISC-V architecture. The goal will be to mimic what Bitluni did in his video here: https://youtu.be/6QRKpd28NEE?si=4e_hz9dqpPGfudkB. No experience is required. Email iwebster@ucsd.edu or DM @jahovajenkins or @b1_bomber on discord if you’re interested.

**Meetings:** Will be coordinated between members.

**Time Requirements:** 2-3 hours/week
