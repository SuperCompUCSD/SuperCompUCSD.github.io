## 1. Raspberry Pi Cluster 
**Description:**
We will be setting up a Raspberry Pi "supercomputing" cluster with industry standard software practices and try running some parallel applications with it.

The project will provide an opportunity to sharpen basic hardware and software skills. Topics covered will include Linux, compilers, parallel programming, and performance tuning applications.

No prior experience is required!

Meetings will be at SDSC Saturdays from 1-3pm

**Learning Goals:**
- Build a Raspberry Pi Cluster to run popular HPC benchmarks/applications and distributed ray tracing. 
- Compete against international teams in SBCC 2024.

**Mentors:** Paco, Matei, Yuchen

**Time Requirement:** 1-3 hours/week

## 2. FPGA Network Interface Card
**Description**
This project will work on programming a Xilinx FPGA to implement a network interface card in verilog alongside the linux kernel driver. If time provides We will work on adding RDMA interoperability with the soft nic.

Some Verilog and C experience required along with some familiarity with the linux kernel is prefered but not required.

Meetings will be at SDSC Fridays from 10am-12pm

**Mentors:** Khai Vu, Kyle Smith

**Time Requirements:** 4-5 hours/week (very likely more)

## 3. Switch interconnect Config
**Description**
This project will be more infrastructure related for the club and will primarily involve learning how to configure switches for various fabrics be it ethernet or infiniband along with configuring the application interfaces such as MPI

Only requirements are some IP stack knowledge along with familiarity with the commandline

Meetings will be at SDSC Fridays from 2-4pm

**Mentors:** Khai Vu

**Time Requirements**: 4-5 hours/week
