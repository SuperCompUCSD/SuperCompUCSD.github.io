# Current Projects 

### Triton Mega Processor:

This is a project led by Professor Bryan Chin of the Computer Science and Engineering department at UCSD. We aim to build a RISC-V CPU that can run simple programs and games. The system in which the CPU is instantiated is implemented in FPGAs for simplicity and flexibility

### ML Project:

Led by our officers (Chanyoung Park, Srujam Dave, and Yixuan Li), members will build an open-source LLM inference system on our NVIDIA GPU cluster. The project will focus on efficient model serving, distributed inference, and performance optimization at scale. We also aim to host a website directly on the cluster to showcase the system, documentation, and performance benchmarks. This platform will serve as a public-facing demo while giving members hands-on experience deploying and maintaining services on real GPU-backed infrastructure.
 

### Linux from Scratch:

Led by a current LFS editor/core-maintainer (Rahul Chandra) members will build a fully-custom graphical distro from the bare cross-compiled toolchain up. By mastering build systems (CMake, Autotools, Ninja and others) and the Linux boot process, participants gain a granular understanding of how software is linked and deployed. The end result is a fully functional Live ISO with an installer.


### Raspberry Pi Workshop:

A collaborated event with Triton Software Engineering Club. An introductory workshop to High Performance Computing focused on exposing participants to Ansible scripting for cluster automation and OpenMPI for running distributed programs like the OSU benchmarks. During the workshop, each participant will get access to and get hands-on experience in an isolated cluster of 4 nodes emulated using Docker swarms on the club’s Rock Pi 5B cluster.

# Past Projects

## Fall 2025

### Raspberry Pi Workshop

This workshop, scheduled for October 15th at 4:30 PM, will teach attendees the basics of setting up a Rasperry Pi. This includes flashing an SSD card with Rocky Linux, setting up a user, connecting the Pi to wifi, and using SSH to enter the Raspberry Pi from an external device.

**Meetings:** October 15th at 4:30 PM in SDSC 

**Mentors:** Ian Webster, Yixuan Li, Srujam Dave, Cecilia Li, Young Park

**Time:** Approx. 3 hours

## Winter 2025

### NASA Parallel Benchmarks

The project aims to set up and run the NASA NAS Parallel Benchmarks on our club nodes. We will focus on setting up MPI on the club nodes, downloading and compiling the benchmarks, and doing minor math (linear algebra) optimizations. This is a simple project, and beginners are welcome. Email amehrotra@ucsd.edu if you’re interested.

**Mentors:** Aarush Mehrotra

**Time Requirement:** 1.5 hours per week

### FPGA Network Interface Card

This project will work on programming a Xilinx FPGA to write some basic accelerators or a processor. Certain classes like ECE111 and CSE141L have these in only simulation, so this is an opportunity to physically test them. If pushed far enough, we may work on writing a linux kernel driver or HLS applications. Anyone is welcome to deviate or write their own HDL for fun.

### Linux from Scratch

This project aims to go through the process of setting up the Linux From Scratch project. This project will help you understand the internals of Linux and hopefully allow people on the edge of making the switch to Linux to learn how to use it better.
