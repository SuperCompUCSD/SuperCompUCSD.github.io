Come meet us in our winter GBM

![wi-gbm](supercomputin-wi-2023-gbm.png)

We are a sub-community of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) UC San Diego student branch, dedicated to high-performance computing specifically. 

**[>> Check out IEEE at UC San Diego!](https://ieeeucsd.org/)**

We love challenging ourselves with interesting projects in domains such as mesh networking, high-performance storage access, accelerated computing and highly-distributed applications. 


IEEE Supercomputing is brought to you by **[SDSC](https://sdsc.edu)** as our main benefactors from for space and hardware resources, as part of the **[HPC Students Program](https://hpc-students.sdsc.edu)**.

All UCSD students are welcome to join us at our workshops and projects with real applications!
