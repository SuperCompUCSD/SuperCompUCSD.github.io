We are a student-run organization dedicated to High Performance Computing! We are supported by the San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC), the CSE, and ECE departments. We are a sub-community of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) branch at UC San Diego. We participate in two annual international competitions and organize projects that teach skills such as hardware design, simulations, and system administration. If you’re interested in any of the following projects or competitions, check out our website and message us on discord or email. Links below!

## Our Programs

{{< section title="Student Cluster Competition" image="/images/scc-section-placeholder.jpg" link="/scc" >}}

The Student Cluster Competition takes place annually at the International Conference for High Performance Computing. Teams of 6-8 students travel with a small cluster we sourced and built to run scientific applications and benchmarks. The UCSD team has consistently placed first in North America for the past four years and won second place worldwide in MLPerf! Registration opens in March.

The Single Board Cluster competition is an annual event where teams of 6-8 students create the most efficient single-board computer cluster that can perform complex tasks while using the least amount of power and resources.

The club organizes multiple projects during the winter and spring quarter. Starting in 2025, we're running projects
involving everything from FPGA programming to Linux from Scratch!
