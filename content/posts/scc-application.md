Hi folks, our team application for the UCSD/SDSC Undergraduate Supercomputing Team is now open. You may apply for the [UCSD SCC Application](https://na.eventscloud.com/ereg/newreg.php?eventid=794536&) until Sunday, April 21st with notifications of results the coming out the following Monday on April 29th.

Our team will compete in the [Student Cluster Competition](https://www.studentclustercompetition.us/) (SCC), held at the SC24 conference. The supercomputing competition is a fun yet challenging international competition that tests undergraduates in their understanding of the full stack of a supercomputer — from high performance hardware, to operating system fundamentals, to performance tuning applications. The competition takes place in-person at the SC conference, a massive 10,000 attendee conference in Atlanta, Georgia this year. To compete, we design our own multi-node server, prepare posters and presentations, and then contend for the highest performance in several hardware benchmarks and scientific applications. 

Of the released information for this year the applications and benchmarks are:
- [High Performance Linpack](https://www.netlib.org/benchmark/hpl/)
- [MLPerf Datacenter Inference](https://mlcommons.org/benchmarks/inference-datacenter/)
- [NAMD](https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/namd/)
- [ICON](https://icon-model.org/)
with more info to be release on the [supercomputing site](https://sc24.supercomputing.org/students/student-cluster-competition/)

Last year we were the **best US team** and the **3rd best in-person team** overall. We also placed 1st in MLPerf benchmark contributing to an open implementation utilising AMD accelerators. Now we are in an even better position than last year — we once again have the mentorship of the world-class scientists and engineers at SDSC, and we also have a few returning student mentors who experienced the previous competition first-hand, and are excited to help you succeed. Every year, we reach out to cutting-edge hardware companies — last year our sponsors included *AMD*, *Supermicro*, and *Liqid* — and these companies both lend us hardware and provide us world-class technical expertise. We are currently choosing our hardware configuration for this year, and we are certain it will be highly competitive.

We hope you will apply to join our team! Even if you're not selected to be part of the core travel team we also have a home team which learns the same material as the travel team and contribute to the team's success at the conference. Also **course credit** is available to fall quarter participants in the form of a CSE 198 class (For Seventh College this can be a High Impact Course Major Requirement).
